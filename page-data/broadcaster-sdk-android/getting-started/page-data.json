It will not receive updates or technical support and may not fully function. For SDKs you have already downloaded, please do not use them to build applications to access the broadcasting functionality, and delete them from your archives.

The SDK gives you full control over the broadcast process, you can build up your own user interface, define your audio and video input sources, callbacks on status changes, and many more.\n\nThis document describes the basic steps and components of the SDK to make an Android app using the IBM Video Streaming SDK.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n### Account prerequisites\nBefore going into details, please note that the document assumes the following:\n*  You have a registered user at [IBM Video Streaming] (or at [IBM WM EU Cluster]).\n*  You have a basic understanding how to use the [Channel API][Channel API Documentation].\n\nIf you have questions, please [contact us].\n\n### Development prerequisites\n\nThe SDK uses the Gradle build system, and it is deployed as an AAR file inside a local `m2repository` along with its dependencies.\n\nThe sample application also uses Gradle.\n\nWe recommend using the latest stable version of Android Studio for development.\n\nThe supported minimum Android API level is 21 (Android version 5.0).\n\n### Using Regional Clusters\n\nIBM Video Streaming hosts an additional Server Cluster in the EU, besides the original world-wide one.\nThese so called regional clusters are completely distinct entities, there's no data transfer among them. A customer account can only reside in one of them.\nYou can read more about the topic in [this article](https://blog.video.ibm.com/streaming-product-updates/server-cluster-in-europe-for-streaming-video/).\n\nBecause of the complete separation of data summarized above, the updated Broadcaster SDK will need to be explicitly supplied with a \"regional cluster\" parameter.\nGiven this parameter the SDK will know which servers it can access to reach the resources that belong to the desired customer account.\n\nPlease also note that an SDK access always belongs to a specific IBM WM cluster. If you'd like to access accounts in different clusters,\nyou will need to setup multiple SDK accesses, more specifically \"Channel API Access\" in case of the Broadcaster SDK for each regional cluster.\nThen you can use these accesses in your application, you can find an example in the supplied sample project.\n\n[IBM Video Streaming]: http://video.ibm.com/\n[IBM WM EU Cluster]: http://eu.video.ibm.com/\n[Channel API Documentation]: https://developers.video.ibm.com/channel-api-basic-channel-management \"IBM Video Streaming Channel API\"\n[contact us]: https://video.ibm.com/enterprise-video/contact\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"7c3ae4213621c96956377d3740abc0ac","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":381},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting Started","description":"Getting Started"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Getting Started\ndescription: Getting Started\n---\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\nPlease note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Video Streaming Broadcaster SDK.
