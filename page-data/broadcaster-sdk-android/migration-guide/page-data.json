This can be intimidating at first, as all of your SDK class imports are now broken.\nBut bear with us, this is easier to solve than it looks. After you’ve set up you new dependencies inside your `build.gradle` file then follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Sync the changes using Gradle\n2. Go to the source files in which you use the IBM Broadcaster SDK\n3. Delete the now unknown, old, “red” imports of SDK classes\n4. Then you can just auto-import the files again with the help of your IDE\n5. When all seems good try and build your project\n6. If it fails it will tell you exactly where the problem is. Go back to step 2. Repeat until it compiles\n\nTo give you some deeper insight into the changes, in general only the top-level packages have changed. Meaning that `com.ibm.cloudvideo.*` (or `tv.ustream.*` in case of REST API components) have changed to `com.ibm.video.android.*`.\nThe inner structure stayed the same as it was, however there were some API changes in the SDK and some class renames and API changes in the additional libraries providing the auxiliary functionalities.\n\n\n### API changes & class renames\n\nSome API classes had to be renamed in the SDK's auxiliary libraries and some functionality had to be refactored slightly for flexibility.\nUnfortunately the IDE can not automatically resolve this, but you can use the handy table below as a guide.\n\n| Component \\ Version | 0.7.0                   | 1.0.0               | Notes                                                                          |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Broadcaster         | AndroidBroadcaster      | AndroidBroadcaster  | Class requires a new mandatory parameter when constructing: `regionalCluster`.
