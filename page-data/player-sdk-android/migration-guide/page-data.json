After you've set up you new dependencies inside\nyour `build.gradle` file then follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Sync the changes using Gradle\n2. Go to the source files in which you use the IBM Player SDK\n3. Delete the now unknown, old, \"red\" imports of SDK classes\n4. Then you can just auto-import the files again with the help of your IDE.\n5. When all seems good try and build your project\n6. If it fails it will tell you exactly where the problem is. Go back to step 2. Repeat until it compiles.\n\nTo give you some deeper insight into the changes, in general only the top-level packages have changed.\nMeaning that `tv.ustream.*` (or `ibm.playersdk.ui.*` in case of UI components) have changed to `com.ibm.video.android.*`.\nThe inner structure stayed the same as it was in case of the core components, however there were\nrestructures & simplifications in case of the UI components library.\n\n### API class renames\n\nSome API classes had to be renamed in the SDK and some functionality had to be refactored slightly for flexibility.\nUnfortunately the IDE can not automatically resolve this, but you can use the handy table below as a guide.\n\n| Component \\ Version | 1.5.0                | 2.0.0             | Notes                                                                          |\n|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Core Android player | UstreamPlayerFactory | PlayerFactory     |                                                                                |\n| Core Android player | UstreamPlayer        | Player            | Managing the MediaPlayerModule is removed from the interface's responsibility. |\n| Core Android player | UstreamPlayer        | ModuleAwarePlayer | Managing the MediaPlayerModule is moved here.                                  |\n| UI Components       | SimpleErrorListener  | NoOpErrorListener | To better reflect what it does.                                                |\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"3f11341046de6879fa42104cc6b73fdd","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":521},"frontmatter":{"title":"Migration Guide","description":"Migration Guide"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Migration Guide\ndescription: Migration Guide\n---\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\nPlease note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Video Streaming Player SDK.
