PlayerView requirements for a plugin will always be stated\nin this documentation but can also be queried from the MediaPlayerModule instance itself using `MediaPlayerModule.getSupportedPlayerViewType()`.\nMake sure to always use the appropriate `PlayerView`.\n\nCreation of the plugin is the user's responsibility, use the constructor of the desired plugin, provide appropriate parameters and set listeners.\nWhen a plugin is passed to a Player instance it will be retained across configuration changes, however the listeners the user provided are not subject\nto the usual `Player.attach()` / `Player.detach()` working. The user needs to manually set and remove those listeners.\nThe current `MediaPlayerModule` in use can be retrieved from the player instance using `Player.getMediaPlayerPlugin()` which returns\na `MediaPlayerModule` that will be cast to the appropriate class that was set during `initWithContent`. The user must know which MediaPlayerModule was\n set during init.\n\nPlease note that while a `MediaPlayerPlugin` provided through `Player.initWithContent` is retained across configuration changes,\nthe plugin itself might NOT support configuration changes at all due to plugin specific reasons. This will always be stated in the plugin's documentation\nunder the **Plugin limitations** section.\n\n## Ads Plugin\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTICE**\n\n*Ads plugin has been sunset and removed from the SDK.
