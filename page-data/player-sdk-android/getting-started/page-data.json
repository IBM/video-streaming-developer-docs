Using the native SDK\ngives you full control over the video player, including a customizable native user interface, callbacks on status changes,\nand more.\n\nThis document describes the basic steps to make a mobile app using the IBM Video Streaming Player SDK for Android.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n### Account prerequisites\n\nPlease note that document assumes the following:\n*  You have a registered user at [IBM Video Streaming] (or at [IBM WM EU Cluster]).\n*   Your IBM Video Streaming user is entitled to use the IBM Video Streaming Player SDK specifically. To verify this, log in to [Dashboard],\nand check [\"API/SDK access\"] under the \"Integrations & Apps\" section.\n\nIf you have any questions, please [contact us].\n\n### Development prerequisites\n\n#### IDE\n\nWe recommend using the latest stable version of Android Studio for development.\n\n#### Build system\n\nThe IBM Video Streaming Player SDK uses the Gradle build system, and it is deployed as an AAR file. The sample application also uses Gradle,\nyou can build it using the provided gradle wrapper: `gradlew`\n\n#### Android API level\n\nThe supported minimum API level is 16 (Android version 4.1)\n\n### Using Regional Clusters\n\nIBM Video Streaming hosts an additional Server Cluster in the EU, besides the original world-wide one.\nThese so called regional clusters are completely distinct entities, there's no data transfer among them. A customer account can only reside in one of them.\nYou can read more about the topic in [this article](https://blog.video.ibm.com/streaming-product-updates/server-cluster-in-europe-for-streaming-video/).\n\nBecause of the complete separation of data summarized above, the updated Player SDK will need to be explicitly supplied with a \"regional cluster\" parameter.\nGiven this parameter the SDK will know which servers it can access to reach the resources that belong to the desired customer account.\n\nPlease also note that an SDK access always belongs to a specific *IBM WM Account* on a specific IBM WM cluster. If you'd like to access different accounts,\nyou will need to setup multiple SDK accesses, more specifically \"Mobile Player SDK Accesses\" in case of the Player SDK for each regional cluster.\nThen you can use these accesses in your application, you can find an example in the supplied sample project.\n\n[Dashboard]: https://video.ibm.com/dashboard\n[\"API/SDK access\"]: https://video.ibm.com/dashboard/integrations/api-access\n[contact us]: https://video.ibm.com/enterprise-video/contact\n[IBM Video Streaming]: http://video.ibm.com/\n[IBM WM EU Cluster]: http://eu.video.ibm.com/\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"24b92228bc2665d0ba4d62a7d3ee98ad","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":520},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting Started","description":"Getting Started"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Getting Started\ndescription: Getting Started\n---\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\nPlease note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Video Streaming Player SDK.
