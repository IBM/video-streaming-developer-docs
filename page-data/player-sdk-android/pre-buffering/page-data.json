(The ID can be the `contentDescriptors.toString()` value for simplicity, if duplicate contents are not required.)\n- Initialize the created player with a **RECORDED** content.\n- Call `pause()` on the player. The Player will buffer the content then it will wait.\nAt this stage it is not required to call `setPlayerListener()`, `setErrorListener()` and `attach()` if the callbacks are not relevant for you.\nBut you are free to do so if you are interested in the callbacks, but make sure you call `detach()` before changing listeners or playerView on the player,\nand call `attach()` again so these changes can take effect.\n- Later when the player is needed set your listeners and the `playerView`, call `attach()`\n- Call `player.play()` and if it is buffered the playback will start instantly.\n\n**Example**:\n\n```java\nPlayerFactory playerFactory = new PlayerFactory(RegionalCluster.WORLD_WIDE, API_KEY, activity);\nContentDescriptor contentDescriptor = new ContentDescriptor(ContentType.RECORDED, 123456L);\nPlayer player1 = playerFactory.createPlayer(contentDescriptor.toString());\nplayer1.initWithContent(contentDescriptor);\nplayer1.pause();\n\n//... AT A LATER POINT, WHEN THE PLAYER IS NEEDED:\n\nplayer1.setPlayerListener(playerListener);\nplayer1.setErrorListener(errorListener);\nplayer1.setPlayerView(playerView);\nplayer1.attach();\nplayer1.play();\n```\n\n**Note**:\n- Only your device capabilities (mostly RAM) limit how many players you can pre-buffer. Keeping too many players can cause an OutOfMemoryError.\n- When the players are no longer needed don't forget to `destroy()` them.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"3061fc98a86f729b2438e6694212ecdc","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":518},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pre-Buffering","description":"Pre-Buffering"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Pre-Buffering\ndescription: Pre-Buffering\n---\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\nPlease note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Video Streaming Player SDK.
