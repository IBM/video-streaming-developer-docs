## Overview

In some API endpoints we apply rate limits. That means you can make limited amount of API request in a specified time intervall from same IP address.

## Headers

If an API endpoint is limited in the header of the response shows your current rate limit status.

| Header                | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| X-RateLimit-Limit     | The number of requests you are allowed to make in the time period |
| X-RateLimit-Remaining | The number of requests remaining in the current time period |
| X-RateLimit-Reset     | The time at which the current rate limit usage resets (Unix timestamp) |

## Limit Exceeded

If you exceeded the limit, a `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` error response returns. You get the limit information header in this case too.
