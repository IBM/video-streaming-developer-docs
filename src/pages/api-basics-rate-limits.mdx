## Overview

In some API endpoints, we apply rate limits. If an API endpoint is limited, the response header returns information about your rate limit balance.

## Headers

If an API endpoint is limited in the header of the response shows your current rate limit status.

| Header                | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| X-RateLimit-Limit     | The number of requests you are allowed to make in the time period |
| X-RateLimit-Remaining | The number of requests remaining in the current time period |
| X-RateLimit-Reset     | The time at which the current rate limit usage resets (Unix timestamp) |

## Limit Exceeded

If the limit is reached, an `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` error response is returned. The response header will contain the limit information in this case too.
