Please note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Video Streaming Player SDK. It will not receive updates or technical support and may not fully function. For SDKs you have already downloaded, please do not use them to build applications and delete them from your archives. You may find information for alternative methods to create customized viewer experiences with our APIs on our [Developer Tools pages](https://developers.video.ibm.com/player-api-examples/custom-ui). Users may also continue to access Video Streaming through the web, both at [video.ibm.com](https://video.ibm.com/) and through Embedded modules.
