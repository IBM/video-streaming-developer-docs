Please note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Watson Media Player SDK and Broadcaster SDK. The SDKs will not receive updates or technical support and may not fully function. For SDKs you have already downloaded, please do not use them to build applications and delete them from your archives. For alternative methods to broadcast live video please visit our [Support Center](https://support.video.ibm.com/hc/en-us/categories/200545448-Broadcasting-on-IBM-Watson-Media). Also you may find information for alternative methods to create customized viewer experiences with our APIs on our [Developer Tools pages](https://developers.video.ibm.com/player-api-examples/custom-ui). Users may also continue to access Watson Media through the web, both at [video.ibm.com](http://video.ibm.com/) and through Embedded modules.

## Authentication
IBM Video Streaming SDK usage requires users to authenticate with an IBM ID or a legacy Ustream account to get access to SDK and IBM Channel API features for example broadcasting or listing.

The authentication happens using **OpenID Connect** which in turn handles the authorization part using **OAuth2.0** protocol.
Earlier versions of the SDK had provided a custom in-house implementation of the above two protocol's Authorization Code flow.
However with the introduction of version 1.0.0 of the SDK, we have removed support for this authorization component.
Instead we encourage you to use your favourite OpenID Connect & OAuth2.0 implementation, this can provide greater flexibility in your application.

Of course we are still providing an example implementation in the provided sample application, but from now on using the official, open-source [AppAuth-Android] library provided by the [OpenID Foundation].
You can find detailed documentation on how to use the auth library on the linked GitHub repository if you need information beyond what the sample application provides.

**Basic steps of authentication & authorization**:
1. Acquiring OpenID configuration
2. Loading the authentication endpoint in a `CustomTab`
3. User authenticates through their login provider
4. User receives an ID Token & Authorization Code
5. Authorization can be used to obtain Access Token using the token endpoint provided by OpenID configuration

Please note that this is a very basic description of what actually happens, and focuses on only the *Authorization Code flow*. OpenID and OAuth2.0 is capable of much more than just this.
For details about authenticating with IBM Video Streaming services see: [API Authentication](https://developers.video.ibm.com/api-basics-authentication) and [API Native app support].
