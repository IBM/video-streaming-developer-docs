## Introduction

The IBM Video Streaming SDK lets you broadcast live videos in your native applications. The SDK gives you full control over the broadcast process, you can build up your own user interface, define your audio and video input sources, callbacks on status changes, and many more.

This document describes the basic steps and components of the SDK to make an Android app using the IBM Video Streaming SDK.

### Development prerequisites

The SDK uses the Gradle build system, and it is deployed as an AAR file inside a local `m2repository` along with its dependencies.

The sample application also uses Gradle.

We recommend using the latest version of Android Studio for development.
