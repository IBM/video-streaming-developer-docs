Please note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Watson Media Player SDK and Broadcaster SDK. The SDKs will not receive updates or technical support and may not fully function. For SDKs you have already downloaded, please do not use them to build applications and delete them from your archives. For alternative methods to broadcast live video please visit our [Support Center](https://support.video.ibm.com/hc/en-us/categories/200545448-Broadcasting-on-IBM-Watson-Media). Also you may find information for alternative methods to create customized viewer experiences with our APIs on our [Developer Tools pages](https://developers.video.ibm.com/player-api-examples/custom-ui). Users may also continue to access Watson Media through the web, both at [video.ibm.com](http://video.ibm.com/) and through Embedded modules.

## Introduction

The IBM Video Streaming SDK lets you broadcast live videos in your native applications. The SDK gives you full control over the broadcast process, you can build up your own user interface, define your audio and video input sources, callbacks on status changes, and many more.

This document describes the basic steps and components of the SDK to make an Android app using the IBM Video Streaming SDK.

## Before you begin

### Account prerequisites
Before going into details, please note that the document assumes the following:
*  You have a registered user at [IBM Watson Media] (or at [IBM WM EU Cluster]).
*  You have a basic understanding how to use the [Channel API][Channel API Documentation].

If you have questions, please [contact us].

### Development prerequisites

The SDK uses the Gradle build system, and it is deployed as an AAR file inside a local `m2repository` along with its dependencies.

The sample application also uses Gradle.

We recommend using the latest stable version of Android Studio for development.

The supported minimum Android API level is 21 (Android version 5.0).

### Using Regional Clusters

IBM Watson Media hosts an additional Server Cluster in the EU, besides the original world-wide one.
These so called regional clusters are completely distinct entities, there's no data transfer among them. A customer account can only reside in one of them.
You can read more about the topic in [this article](https://blog.video.ibm.com/streaming-product-updates/server-cluster-in-europe-for-streaming-video/).

Because of the complete separation of data summarized above, the updated Broadcaster SDK will need to be explicitly supplied with a "regional cluster" parameter.
Given this parameter the SDK will know which servers it can access to reach the resources that belong to the desired customer account.

Please also note that an SDK access always belongs to a specific IBM WM cluster. If you'd like to access accounts in different clusters,
you will need to setup multiple SDK accesses, more specifically "Channel API Access" in case of the Broadcaster SDK for each regional cluster.
Then you can use these accesses in your application, you can find an example in the supplied sample project.
