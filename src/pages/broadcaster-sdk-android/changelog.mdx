<InlineNotification kind="warning">

Please note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Watson Media Player SDK and Broadcaster SDK. The SDKs will not receive updates or technical support and may not fully function. For SDKs you have already downloaded, please do not use them to build applications and delete them from your archives. For alternative methods to broadcast live video please visit our [Support Center](https://support.video.ibm.com/hc/en-us/categories/200545448-Broadcasting-on-IBM-Watson-Media). Also you may find information for alternative methods to create customized viewer experiences with our APIs on our [Developer Tools pages](https://developers.video.ibm.com/player-api-examples/custom-ui). Users may also continue to access Watson Media through the web, both at [video.ibm.com](http://video.ibm.com/) and through Embedded modules.

## 1.0.0 - 2022-06-10
### Added
- RegionalCluster support; enables the possibility to connect to the IBM WM instance running in EU too. See details in [getting started](./getting-started#using-regions-clusters)

### Changed
- A long due overhaul of namings and packages throughout the SDK
- `AndroidBroadcaster` constructor requires `regionalCluster` parameter explicitly specified
- `UstreamApiClient` requires `serviceUrl` parameter explicitly specified
- See the [migration guide](./migration-guide) and the sample project for details

### Removed
- OAuth capabilities removed from `UstreamApiClient`, it was limited anyway
- The "Authorizer" auxiliary library has been replaced with OpenID AppAuth-Android library.
- See the [migration guide](./migration-guide) and the sample project for details

## 0.7.0 - 2020-07-21
### Changed
- Migrated from old Compat Lib to AndroidX
- Migrated to new restapi module (com.ibm.cloudvideo.android.restapi v0.2.3)
- Fixed connection issues on older Android versions

## 0.6.2 - 2020-05-08
### Changed
- Fixed an issue where starting another broadcast quickly right after the first one is finished could in some cases cause the seconds to stall at starting state.

## 0.6.1 - 2020-03-24
### Changed
- Minor improvements and bug fixes around diagnostics to help us better trace potential issues.

### Added
- RTMPS support. The SDK automatically uses TLS secured RTMP connections by default from now on.

### Known Issues
- The SDK on devices running Android 6.0 or earlier might crash when the internet connection goes down during a broadcast.

## 0.6.0 - 2019-11-25
### Changed
 - Lifecycle of DiagnosticID. The implicit 30 minutes timeout of DiagnosticID has been removed, now it always resets after the end of a broadcast. 
This way every broadcast session has its own diagnosticID. As a best practice we recommend using the `getDiagnosticId()` function in `AndroidBroadcaster` 
when the preview is started (happens in the `onReady()` state callback).
Consult the documentation (README.md) section "Diagnosing a problem" for more information.

### Added
 - 5 seconds delay before the RTMP tunnel is closed to try to mitigate stream end cut-off. (Includes new `rtmpc-android` 0.3.0 dependency)


## 0.5.0 - 2019-10-29
### Changed
 - Use `rest-api-java` `v0.0.43`
 - `BroadcastSettings` renamed to `IngestSettings`
 - `BroadcastSettingsLoaderError` renamed to `IngestSettingsLoaderError`
 
### Added 
 - New HTTP error code parameter in `IngestSettingsLoaderError`


## 0.4.1 - 2019-10-16
### Fixed
 - possible AAC issues

## 0.4.0 - 2019-09-23
Initial release
### Added
- Ability to broadcast
- Change camera between broadcasts
- Authenticator to help with IBM auth flow
