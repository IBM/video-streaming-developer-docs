## 1.0.0 - 2022-06-10
### Added
- RegionalCluster support; enables the possibility to connect to the IBM WM instance running in EU too. See details in [getting started](./getting-started#using-regions-clusters)

### Changed
- A long due overhaul of namings and packages throughout the SDK
- `AndroidBroadcaster` constructor requires `regionalCluster` parameter explicitly specified
- `UstreamApiClient` requires `serviceUrl` parameter explicitly specified
- See the [migration guide](./migration-guide) and the sample project for details

### Removed
- OAuth capabilities removed from `UstreamApiClient`, it was limited anyway
- The "Authorizer" auxiliary library has been replaced with OpenID AppAuth-Android library.
- See the [migration guide](./migration-guide) and the sample project for details

## 0.7.0 - 2020-07-21
### Changed
- Migrated from old Compat Lib to AndroidX
- Migrated to new restapi module (com.ibm.cloudvideo.android.restapi v0.2.3)
- Fixed connection issues on older Android versions

## 0.6.2 - 2020-05-08
### Changed
- Fixed an issue where starting another broadcast quickly right after the first one is finished could in some cases cause the seconds to stall at starting state.

## 0.6.1 - 2020-03-24
### Changed
- Minor improvements and bug fixes around diagnostics to help us better trace potential issues.

### Added
- RTMPS support. The SDK automatically uses TLS secured RTMP connections by default from now on.

### Known Issues
- The SDK on devices running Android 6.0 or earlier might crash when the internet connection goes down during a broadcast.

## 0.6.0 - 2019-11-25
### Changed
 - Lifecycle of DiagnosticID. The implicit 30 minutes timeout of DiagnosticID has been removed, now it always resets after the end of a broadcast. 
This way every broadcast session has its own diagnosticID. As a best practice we recommend using the `getDiagnosticId()` function in `AndroidBroadcaster` 
when the preview is started (happens in the `onReady()` state callback).
Consult the documentation (README.md) section "Diagnosing a problem" for more information.

### Added
 - 5 seconds delay before the RTMP tunnel is closed to try to mitigate stream end cut-off. (Includes new `rtmpc-android` 0.3.0 dependency)


## 0.5.0 - 2019-10-29
### Changed
 - Use `rest-api-java` `v0.0.43`
 - `BroadcastSettings` renamed to `IngestSettings`
 - `BroadcastSettingsLoaderError` renamed to `IngestSettingsLoaderError`
 
### Added 
 - New HTTP error code parameter in `IngestSettingsLoaderError`


## 0.4.1 - 2019-10-16
### Fixed
 - possible AAC issues

## 0.4.0 - 2019-09-23
Initial release
### Added
- Ability to broadcast
- Change camera between broadcasts
- Authenticator to help with IBM auth flow
