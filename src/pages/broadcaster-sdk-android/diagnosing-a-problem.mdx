Please note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Watson Media Player SDK and Broadcaster SDK. The SDKs will not receive updates or technical support and may not fully function. For SDKs you have already downloaded, please do not use them to build applications and delete them from your archives. For alternative methods to broadcast live video please visit our [Support Center](https://support.video.ibm.com/hc/en-us/categories/200545448-Broadcasting-on-IBM-Watson-Media). Also you may find information for alternative methods to create customized viewer experiences with our APIs on our [Developer Tools pages](https://developers.video.ibm.com/player-api-examples/custom-ui). Users may also continue to access Watson Media through the web, both at [video.ibm.com](http://video.ibm.com/) and through Embedded modules.

IBM Video Streaming SDK sends diagnostic data along with the video stream to IBM servers. Diagnostic data contains only transmit statistics, capture events. It does not contain personal information.

## Diagnostic ID
Session diagnostic ID is an autogenerated unique identifier that helps IBM identify diagnostic data — produced during the current broadcast session — across IBM systems. SDK users can't access the diagnostic data using the diagnostic ID, rather SDK users should use this ID to report a possible problem during a broadcast session. The accompanying diagnostic data will be used by IBM internally to debug your specific issue.

Please note that the diagnostic ID may change over time, therefore it is best to not cache or store this value.

**Lifecycle of diagnosticID**:
The `diagnosticID` is first generated when the `AndroidBroadcaster` instance is created and re-generated after each broadcast stop, thus every broadcast session has its unique `diagnosticID`.

**Accessing diagnosticID**:
You can always access the current ID via `getDiagnosticId()` function in `AndroidBroadcaster`.
If you want to store a diagnostic ID for a later bug report of the current session, we recommend to save it when the SDK *instance is created* ( `AndroidBroadcaster`'s constructor) and update it whenever the *SDK's preview has started* ( `Broadcaster.LifeCycleListener.onReady()` callback).

If your app has its own diagnostics reporting you can send the diagnostic ID to your own records.
