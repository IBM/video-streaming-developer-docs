Please note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Video Streaming Broadcaster SDK. It will not receive updates or technical support and may not fully function. For SDKs you have already downloaded, please do not use them to build applications to access the broadcasting functionality, and delete them from your archives. You may find information on alternative methods to broadcast live video to your channel on our [Support Center](https://support.video.ibm.com/hc/en-us/categories/200545448-Broadcasting-on-IBM-Watson-Media).
