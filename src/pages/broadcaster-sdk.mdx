Please note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Watson Media Player SDK and Broadcaster SDK. The SDKs will not receive updates or technical support and may not fully function. For SDKs you have already downloaded, please do not use them to build applications and delete them from your archives. For alternative methods to broadcast live video please visit our [Support Center](https://support.video.ibm.com/hc/en-us/categories/200545448-Broadcasting-on-IBM-Watson-Media). Also you may find information for alternative methods to create customized viewer experiences with our APIs on our [Developer Tools pages](https://developers.video.ibm.com/player-api-examples/custom-ui). Users may also continue to access Watson Media through the web, both at [video.ibm.com](http://video.ibm.com/) and through Embedded modules.
