### This example demonstrates how you can build a custom UI based on our API calls.

There are some important technical informations about a custom UI implementation:

- there is no progress event from the player, so you should query the progress periodically (using the `playing` event to disable unnecessary querying will increase performance)
- `progress` and `duration` is in seconds, so every percentage related progress data (like a seekbar) should be calculated from this two data
- if you would like to build a full custom UI on the player, use the `controls=false&showtitle=false` url params to hide the default IBM Video Streaming UI components
- autoplay permission must be delegated on cross-origin iframes since Chrome 66 for video elements by policy. Therefore, the iframe tag must contain an `allow="autoplay"` feature policy attribute to allow play calls from a cross-orgin parent to the player iframe.

### Example

import EmbedPlayer from '../../components/EmbedPlayer';

<EmbedPlayer

  controls={['custom']}
/>
