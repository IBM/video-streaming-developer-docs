## Introduction

The IBM Video Streaming Player SDK lets you play IBM Video Streaming live and recorded videos in your native applications. Using the native SDK gives you full control over the player, including a customizable native user interface, callbacks on status changes, and many more.

This document describes the basic steps to make a mobile app using the Player SDK for iOS.

## Before you begin

### Account prerequisites

Please note that document assumes the following:
*   You have a registered user at [IBM Watson Media] (or at [IBM WM EU Cluster]).
*   Your IBM Video Streaming user is entitled to use the IBM Video Streaming Player SDK specifically. Log-in to [Dashboard],
and check ["API/SDK access"] under the "Integrations & Apps" section.

If you have any questions, please [contact us].

### Development prerequisites

#### IDE

We recommend using the most recent version of Xcode.

#### Minimum OS version

The Player SDK requires iOS 11.0 or above.

### Using Regional Clusters

IBM Watson Media hosts an additional Server Cluster in the EU, besides the original world-wide one.
These so called regional clusters are completely distinct entities, there's no data transfer among them. A customer account can only reside in one of them.
You can read more about the topic in [this article](https://blog.video.ibm.com/streaming-product-updates/server-cluster-in-europe-for-streaming-video/).

Because of the complete separation of data summarized above, the updated Player SDK will need to be explicitly supplied with a "regional cluster" parameter.
Given this parameter the SDK will know which servers it can access to reach the resources that belong to the desired customer account.

Please also note that an SDK access always belongs to a specific *IBM WM Account* on a specific IBM WM cluster. If you'd like to access different accounts,
you will need to setup multiple SDK accesses, more specifically "Mobile Player SDK Accesses" in case of the Player SDK for each regional cluster.
Then you can use these accesses in your application, you can find an example in the supplied sample project.
