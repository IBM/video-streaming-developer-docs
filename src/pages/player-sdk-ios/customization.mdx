Please note that as of November 1st, 2022 the IBM Watson Media Player SDK will not receive new updates or support. You may find information for alternative methods to create customized viewer experiences with our APIs on our [Developer Tools](https://developers.video.ibm.com/player-api-examples/custom-ui) pages. Users may also continue to access Watson Media through the web, both at [video.ibm.com](http://video.ibm.com/) and through Embedded modules.

## Player UI

`USUstreamPlayer` includes a full-featured user interface by default, including a control bar, loading and error views. You can change this behavior by setting the `playerControlStyle` property of the player. By setting it to `USPlayerControlStyleNone` you can instruct the player to display media only, without any decoration views.
In case you don’t want to handle all the player states and error cases manually, you can also reconfigure the control bars by setting their content using the `USUstreamPlayer (USToolbar)` category.
You can set any of the player toolbar’s contents using the `-[USToolbar setToolbarItems:animated:]` API. The standard toolbar items are accessible in the `USUstreamPlayer (USToolbar)` category Of course you can create your own items as well by subclassing `USToolbarItem`.

## Background audio

`USUstreamPlayer` can be configured for background playback, meaning that if the app goes to background the audio will continue to play.
To enable the feature: change your application's "Background Mode" to _Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture_ (select your project file, select "Capabilities" tab, open "Background Mode", and select "Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture").
Please note that this feature needs to be enabled per `USUstreamPlayer` instance, by setting the `continuePlaybackInBackground` property to `YES`. To configure the Control Center and Lock Screen audio control widget please refer to "Background Player" sample in our _Sample App_.

## Localization

The SDK by default provides all texts in English only.
If you want to support other languages and/or redefine certain text, add the keys listed below into the localization files of your application. If you don’t redefine these keys, then the SDK will fall back to the localizations included in the resource bundle of the SDK.
