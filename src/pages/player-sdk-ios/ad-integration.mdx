## Introduction

The SDK supports serving ads with Google's DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) service.

## Usage

1. Add Google IMA SDK for iOS to the project either by CocoaPods or manually as it is described in [IMA SDK's developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/ios/).
2. Generate Google IMA tag on [DFP Dashboard](https://www.google.com/dfp/) under Inventory/units.
3. Create a `USUstreamPlayer` instance.
4. Configure ad serving using `configureAdServiceWithGoogleIMATag:customMetadata:minAdFreeTimeInterval:allowPreroll:` or `configureAdServiceWithGoogleIMATag:customMetadata:cuePoints:allowPreroll:`.
