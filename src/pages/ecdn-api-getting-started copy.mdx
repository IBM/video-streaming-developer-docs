## Introduction

The IBM ECDN (Enterprise Content Delivery Network) API lets you monitor and manage your ECDN locations, servers and other resources.

## Try it out

[API Browser](https://ecdn.video.ibm.com/graphiql) is the easiest way to try ECDN's GraphQL API.
You can log in via your ECDN credentials.
Generated documentation can be found by opening `Docs` in the upper-right corner, which are also available on this site.

## GraphQL

We suggest reading the [official GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/)
to get a basic understanding of its usage. This documentation focuses on ECDN specific usage.

### All/specific resources

We will use `servers` and `locations` throughout this document, which covers all servers and/or all locations when used.
If you want to query them one-by-one use `serverByID` and `locationByID` instead. i.e:

```graphql
{
	locations {
		id
		name
	}
}
```

will return ID and name of all locations, where

```graphql
{
	locationByID(id:"bG9jYXRpb246MzA1") {
		id
		name
	}
}
```

will return ID and name of location with ID of `"bG9jYXRpb246MzA1"` only (if it exists).

### Example queries

- Locations ID, name, external ranges and number of servers.

	```graphql
	{
		locations {
			id
			name
			numberOfServers
			externalRanges
		}
	}
	```

- Servers ID, FQDN, CPU, memory, system disk size (in bytes), cache disk size (in bytes), IP address,
	location name, ECDN version with patch level and last check in date.

	```graphql
	{
		servers {
			id
			fqdn
			lastCheckIn
			location {
				name
			}
			update {
				ecdnVersion
				patchLevel
			}
			hardware {
				cpuCores
				memory
				systemDiskSize
				cacheDiskSize
			}
			desiredConfiguration {
				interfaces{
					localIP
				}
			}
		}
	}
	```

- Servers ID, FQDN, detailed health and status of video delivery.

	```graphql
	{
		servers {
			id
			fqdn
			health {
				contentDelivery {
					aggregated
					upstreams
					caching
				}
				operations {
					aggregated
					updates
					softwareVersion
					apiConnection
					metrics
					ntp
					logForward
					remoteAssistance
					snmp
				}
			}
			videoDelivery {
				currentNumberOfViewers
				currentNumberOfBuffering
			}
		}
	}
	```

## Basic workflow

1. Fetch tokens.

	```sh
	curl 'https://api.ecdn.video.ibm.com/v1/login' \
		-d '{"email":"...","password":"..."}'
	```

	Returns:

	```json
	{
		# JWT token, see https://jwt.io.
		"accessToken": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
		# This can only be used once.
		"refreshToken": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN",
		# Currently, refresh token expires in one day.
		"refreshAgeSeconds": 86400
	}
	```

2. Use API with access token. Note that all if you had a query `{servers{id}}` at API Browser,
	 you must send it as `'{"query":"{servers{id}}"}'` if you use the API directly.

	```sh
	curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
		https://api.ecdn.video.ibm.com/v1/graphql \
		-d '{"query":"{servers{id}}"}'
	```

3. Refresh tokens. Currently your access token expires in 5 minutes.
	 The actual expiration time can be extracted from [JWT](https://jwt.io)'s `exp` field.
	 Therefore, you must use your refresh token to request a new access token before/if it expires.

	```sh
	curl 'https://api.ecdn.video.ibm.com/v1/token/refresh' \
		-d '{"refreshToken":"YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"}'
	```

	Returns:
	
	```json
	{
		# JWT token, see https://jwt.io.
		"accessToken": "YOUR_NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN",
		# This can only be used once.
		"refreshToken": "YOUR_NEW_REFRESH_TOKEN",
		# Currently, refresh token expires in one day.
		"refreshAgeSeconds": 86400
	}
	```
