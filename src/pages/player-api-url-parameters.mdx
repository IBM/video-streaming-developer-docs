title: URL Parameters
description: Query Parameters Used with The Player
---

## Overview

There are a lot of options to configure the feature set and behavior during player initialization. The player looks for URL query parameters included in the src of the Player iframe to set these prefences to the whole playback session.

### Example

This example shows an iframe in which the player would hide the title bar, the LIVE badge and the viewer numbers from viewers:

```html
<iframe id="PlayerIframe" src="https://video.ibm.com/embed/1524?html5ui?hideTitle&hideLiveBadge&hideViewerNumbers" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>
```

## URL parameters to change the behavior of the Player

The default behavior of the player can be modified by extending the src URL with any of the following parameters:

| Parameter       | Effect                                                                                                                                                                      | Values         | Default |
