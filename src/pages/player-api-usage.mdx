## Overview

The Player API enables sites using the [IBM Video Streaming](https://video.ibm.com/) embed iframe to build and adapt on the embed live player.

The Player API provides basic methods to control the live stream or recorded video playback and enables the user to access essential events of the live stream or the played video.

The Player API requires the [postMessage](http://www.w3.org/TR/webmessaging/) DOM API, it won't work in browsers that does not support the postMessage API.

## Usage

First, a valid IBM Video Streaming embed iframe will be needed to use the Embed API. Log in to your managed <a href="https://video.ibm.com/" target="_blank">IBM Video Streaming</a> account as an administrator of your channel. Then navigate to the Embed Configurator page on your Dashboard by selecting the "Embed" option as seen below:

![Embed Configurator Page Location](/static-content/embed-configurator-page-location.png)

After selecting an option with the IBM Video Streaming Player, the Embed Configurator is displayed. The Configurator enables channel administrators to set the properties of the Player embed. When it's done, the proper iframe HTML element can be copied to the clipboard with the button which is highlighted in the next picture.

![Copy To Clipboard Button Location](/static-content/embed-configurator-copy-to-clipboard.png)

The next step is to include a unique ID in this iframe element. We will use "PlayerIframe".

Download the Player API from npm:
```bash
npm install ibm-video-streaming-web-player-api
```

Create an instance of the Embed API by providing the ID of the iframe. The iframe code should look like this:

```html
<iframe id="PlayerIframe" src="https://video.ibm.com/embed/recorded/131906526" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>
```
```js
let viewer = PlayerAPI('PlayerIframe');
```

Content Owners can customize their Player's user experience by [using query parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters) in the src url above. The list of available URL parameters and their effects can be found here: [URL Parameters](/player-api-url-parameters)

## Method Calls

Using the `callMethod` function one can call command methods on the player. Available commands:

### play

Starts playing the currently loaded channel or video.

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('play');
```

### pause

Pauses the live stream, or the playback of a video.

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('pause');
```

### stop

Pauses the live stream. For on demand videos it stops and jumps back to the start.

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('stop');
```

### load

Loads a channel or a video in the player. Requires two additional arguments:

- `type` - content type ('channel' or 'video')
- `id` - media id

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('load', 'video', 5903947);
viewer.callMethod('load', 'channel', 23935269);
```

### seek

Jumps to given position in a recorded video. Requires one argument:

- `position` - target time in seconds

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('seek', 180);
```

### volume

Sets the playback sound volume. Requires one argument:

- `volume` - percent between 0 and 100

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('volume', 0); //mute
```

### quality

Sets the stream quality, if available. Requires one argument:

-  an `id` key from received quality options in `quality` event

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('quality', 0); //set to highest quality
```

### cc (closed caption)

Displays the selected closed caption if available. You can use the 'None' option by using -1 as the argument. Otherwise it requires this argument:

-  an `index` key from the received closed caption object in `cc` event

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('cc', 1); //enables the closed caption with index 1
viewer.callMethod('cc', -1); //disables the closed caption
```

### webkitEnterFullscreen (iOS)

Calls `webkitEnterFullscreen` on the `HTMLVideoElement` to access the video's native fullscreen UI.

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('webkitEnterFullscreen');
```

## Showing and hiding components

Toggle the visibility of different components by calling one of the methods below:

- `hideAudioSwitch`
- `hideCTA`
- `hidePlayScreen`
- `hideCaptionSearch`
- `hideChapters`
- `hideCustomLogo`
- `hideLogo`
- `hideShare`
- `hideFacebook`
- `hideTwitter`
- `hideCopyLink`
- `hideEmbedCode`
- `hideCC`
- `hideTitle`
- `hideViewerNumbers`
- `hideLiveBadge`
- `hideReplayBadge`
- `hideFullscreen`
- `hidePlaybackSpeed`
- `hideSeekbar`

The default value of all of them is **false**.

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('hideCTA',true);
```

## getProperty

Retrieves a property of the embed player. This method is __asynchronous__, the data will be passed to a callback function, given as argument.

Accessible properties by `getProperty`:

### duration

Get the video duration in `seconds.milliseconds` precision.

###### Example

```js
viewer.getProperty('duration', function (duration) {
    ...
}); //passed value is e.g. 120.345
```

### viewers

Get the current viewer count for the loaded live stream. Doesn't return anything in case of recorded videos.

###### Example

```js
viewer.getProperty('viewers', function (viewerNumber) {
    ...
});
```

### allTimeTotalViewers

Get the accumulated total viewer number for the loaded channel. Doesn't return anything in case of recorded videos.

###### Example

```js
viewer.getProperty('allTimeTotalViewers', function (allTimeTotalViewers) {
    ...
});
```

### progress

Get the current progress for recorded video playback, in seconds.

###### Example

```js
viewer.getProperty('progress', function (progress) {
    ...
});
```

### content

Get the current content type and ID as an array.

###### Example

```js
viewer.getProperty('content', function (content) {
    // content == ['channel', 23935269]
    // or
    // content == ['recorded', 12345678]
    ...
});
```

### playingContent

Get the actual content type and ID as an array. This will return the currently played off-air video's ID if the loaded content is an off-air channel or with the channel ID if the channel is live.

###### Example

```js
viewer.callMethod('load', 'channel', 23935269);
// ...
viewer.getProperty('playingContent', function (content) {
    // content == ['channel', 23935269]
    //  - if it's live, or
    // content == ['recorded', 123456]
    //  - if it's off-air and has off-air video content, or
    // content == []
    //  - if it's off-air and doesn't have off-air video content
    ...
});
```

### volume

Get the player volume. This will return the actual value of volume in percent.

###### Example

```js
viewer.getProperty('volume', function (volume) {
    // volume == 0 for muted playback
    ...
});
```

## addListener & removeListener

The embedded player dispatches several events during playback. This method adds or removes event handlers to these events.

The event handler callback receives two arguments:

- `type` the type of the event
- `data` optional data sent along the event (this can be an array, object or boolean variable)

For example:

```js
viewer.addListener('playing', function (type, data) {
    console.log(type); // "playing"
    console.log(data); // true or false
});
```

Available events for `addListener` and `removeListener`:

### live

Called when the currently loaded offline channel becomes live.

###### Example

```js
viewer.addListener('live', callback);
```

### offline

Called when the currently loaded live channel goes offline.

###### Example

```js
viewer.addListener('offline', callback);
```

### finished

Called when the currently loaded and played recorded video reaches its end.

###### Example

```js
viewer.addListener('finished', callback);
```
