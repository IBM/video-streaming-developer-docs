title: Upload videos
description: Channel API Video management Upload videos
---

To upload a file you must do the following steps:

1. Initiate an upload process by an API call. In the response you can find the video ID for the new upload and an upload ID that you will have to send with every request.
2. Upload the video in 1MB parts. You might need to make several requests in this stage until all the parts of the video file have been uploaded.
3. When the upload is finished, send an "upload complete" signal, which will start the processing of your video.
4. Call the API to check the status of processing the video.

## Initialize an upload

Initiate the upload process.

```
POST https://api.video.ibm.com/v2/channels/{channel_id}/uploads.json

## Upload the video file

In this stage you need to upload the video file in 1MB parts. You can find an example of this in the downloadable PHP sample code: https://developers.video.ibm.com/channel-api-php-sample-code

Before you start uploading the parts, you will need to calculate the total number of parts and the total size of the file.

To upload one part send a multi-part file request to this endpoint:

```
POST https://api.video.ibm.com/v2/channels/{channel_id}/uploads/{video_id}/part.json
```
