## Requesting a downloadable version of a video

The downloadable version of a video is not always available, and you have to request us to generate a temporary video file for download. The workflow is the following:

1. Use this call to request a downloadable file.
2. Poll the same API resource for status updates.
3. Use the value of the `download_url` property as soon as it is available.

You have 24 hours to download the video file  after it becomes available. Please refer to the property `expires_at` for the proper timing.

```
POST https://api.video.ibm.com/videos/{video_id}/downloadable/{video_format}.json
```

The `{video_format}` can be mp4 or flv.

If everything works as expected, you'll instantly get the same response format as the GET version provides, but the property `status` will be `pending` or `available`.
