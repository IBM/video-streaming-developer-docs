IBM Video Streaming SDK provides a secure way to authenticate users with IBM ID or legacy Ustream account and getting access for IBM Channel API features for example listing or broadcasting. `IBMWatsonMediaAuthClient` wraps up [IBM Video Streaming Channel APIs Authentication flow](https://developers.video.ibm.com/channel-api/getting-started.html#authorization-flows_2) and implements a basic authentication service that present the IBM Video Streaming authentication site in an embedded `SFSafariViewController` on iOS or in default browser on macOS.

Current authentication flow:

- Set up the authentication client with `configureClientWithClientID:redirectURI:completion:` must be called prior to any other requests.
- Open login site with `requestLoginWithPresenter:completion:` on iOS or `requestLoginWithCompletion:` on macOS.
- Place `handleRedirectURL:` into AppDelegates `openURL` callback for handling redirection.
- If user successfully logged in credentials (access token, refresh token, id token payload) will be accessible via `IBMWatsonMediaAuthClient` properties. See `IBMWatsonMediaAuthClient.h` for more details.
- If access token expires a new one can be requested with `requestFreshTokensWithCompletion:` it gets a new access token with `IBMWatsonMediaAuthClient`s `refreshToken`.
- For log out host app should call `requestLogoutWithPresenter:completion:` on iOS or `requestLoginWithCompletion:` on macOS. These methods opens authentication site for invalidate tokens and other credentials.

For more details see sample apps or visit [IBM Video Streaming Channel API](https://developers.video.ibm.com/channel-api/getting-started.html) page for more information about Channel API usage.
