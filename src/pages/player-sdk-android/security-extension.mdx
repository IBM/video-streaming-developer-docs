Please note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Watson Media Player SDK. It will not receive updates or technical support and may not fully function. For SDKs you have already downloaded, please do not use them to build applications and delete them from your archives. You may find information for alternative methods to create customized viewer experiences with our APIs on our [Developer Tools pages](https://developers.video.ibm.com/player-api-examples/custom-ui). Users may also continue to access Watson Media through the web, both at [video.ibm.com](https://video.ibm.com/) and through Embedded modules.

We recently dropped support of deprecated versions of TLS, and only support TLS 1.2 SSL connection to our services. Older Android versions (below 5.0) do not support TLS 1.2 out of the box, if you are targeting these versions you need to include and configure an extra dependency ([Android Security Provider](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-gms-provider.html)):

```gradle
implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:$actualVersionOfPlayServices"
```

```java
import com.google.android.gms.security.ProviderInstaller;

//...

if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
    ProviderInstaller.installIfNeededAsync(context, listener);
}
```
