We recently dropped support of deprecated versions of TLS, and only support TLS 1.2 SSL connection to our services. Older Android versions (below 5.0) do not support TLS 1.2 out of the box, if you are targeting these versions you need to include and configure an extra dependency ([Android Security Provider](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-gms-provider.html)):

```gradle
implementation "com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:$actualVersionOfPlayServices"
```

```java
import com.google.android.gms.security.ProviderInstaller;

//...

if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
    ProviderInstaller.installIfNeededAsync(context, listener);
}
```
