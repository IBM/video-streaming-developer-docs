IBM Player SDK version 1.1.0 introduced a plugin system which enables you to extend the media player with additional features.
Plugins will be provided by IBM and must be provided during player initialization in `UstreamPlayer.initWithContent(ContentDescriptor, MediaPlayerModule)`.
These extensions may require different player views than `tv.ustream.player.android.PlayerView`. PlayerView requirements for a plugin will always be stated
in this documentation but can also be queried from the MediaPlayerModule instance itself using `MediaPlayerModule.getSupportedPlayerViewType()`.
Make sure to always use the appropriate `PlayerView`.

Creation of the plugin is the user's responsibility, use the constructor of the desired plugin, provide appropriate parameters and set listeners.
When a plugin is passed to a UstreamPlayer instance it will be retained across configuration changes, however the listeners the user provided are not subject
to the usual `UstreamPlayer.attach()` / `UstreamPlayer.detach()` working. The user needs to manually set and remove those listeners.
The current `MediaPlayerModule` in use can be retrieved from the player instance using `UstreamPlayer.getMediaPlayerPlugin()` which returns
a `MediaPlayerModule` that will be cast to the appropriate class that was set during `initWithContent`. The user must know which MediaPlayerModule was
 set during init.

Please note that while a `MediaPlayerPlugin` provided through `UstreamPlayer.initWithContent` is retained across configuration changes,
the plugin itself might NOT support configuration changes at all due to plugin specific reasons. This will always be stated in the plugin's documentation
under the **Plugin limitations** section.

## Ads Plugin

IBM Player SDK version 1.1.0 introduced **Ads Plugin** (called `AdsMediaPlayerModuleAndroid`) which can be used to provide ads for the audience using the developer's
*Double Click for Publishers* account.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**

*Ads plugin has been deprecated in version 1.5 of the SDK and it is scheduled to be removed in the next upcoming MAJOR version (2.0).
Support is no longer provided for this component of the Player SDK.*

Supported features:
- Pre-roll video ads
- Mid-roll video ads with multiple configurable scheduling via `AdScheduleRule`s
- Customizable ad parameters via key/value pairs

Ads plugin needs to be instantiated and passed to the `UstreamPlayer` instance via `initWithContent(ContentDescriptor, MediaPlayerModule)`.
Upon plugin creation the user can provide the following configuration data: `String dfpTagUrl`, `AdScheduleRule scheduleRule`,
where `dfpTagUrl` points to the user's *Double Click for Publishers* account and `adScheduleRule` is the class defining when to show ads.
See javadoc for details.

Additionally, any time after creation the user can set:
- an `AdStateListener` using `AdsMediaPlayerModuleAndroid.setAdStateListener(AdStateListener)` which notifies the user when an ad is being displayed.
- `AdData` which is targeting metadata for *DFP*. Feel free to use your own meta and/or meta provided by `MetaDataListener.onMetaData(MetaData)`.

### Example usage
Add the Ads Plugin to your build use same local m2 repository in project root folder and add these lines to your gradle file (Google IMA SDK is a dependency of the Ads Plugin):

```gradle
implementation 'tv.ustream.player:ibm-player-sdk-android-plugin-ads-external:1.4.0@aar'
implementation 'com.google.ads.interactivemedia.v3:interactivemedia:3.11.3'
implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:17.0.0'
implementation 'androidx.browser:browser:1.0.0'
```

In `AndroidManifest.xml` set configChanges settings in the player activity as:

```xml
<activity
        android:name="com.my.company.PlayerActivity"
        android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|keyboardHidden"
        android:label="@string/app_name" />
```

Create a UstreamPlayer as usual, but provide an `AdsMediaPlayerModule` at init:
```java
ustreamPlayer = ustreamPlayerFactory.createUstreamPlayer(playerId);
if (!ustreamPlayer.isInitialized()) {
    final AdScheduleRule scheduleRule = new FixedIntervalRule(true, 60000); // Schedules a pre-roll and inserts mid-rolls after 60 seconds of playback time
    ustreamPlayer.initWithContent(contentDescriptor, new AdsMediaPlayerModuleAndroid(/* AdsStateListener */this, DFP_TAG_URL, scheduleRule));
}
```

In your application's layout file use `tv.ustream.player.android.plugin.ads.AdsPlayerView` (instead of regular `tv.ustream.player.android.PlayerView`).

```xml
<FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:background="@android:color/black">

    <tv.ustream.player.android.plugin.ads.AdsPlayerView
        android:id="@+id/playerview"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_gravity="center"/>

</FrameLayout>
```

Retrieve the plugin after init:

```java
AdsMediaPlayerModuleAndroid mediaPlayerPlugin = ustreamPlayer.getMediaPlayerPlugin();
```

Set an `AdsStateListener` on the plugin:

```java
mediaPlayerPlugin.setAdStateListener(new AdStateListener() {
    @Override
    public void adStarted() {
        // Customize UI elements during ad playback, e.g: hide seekbar
        seekBar.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
        muteToggleButton.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
        fullScreenToggleButton.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
    }

    @Override
    public void adFinished() {
        // Restore UI elements after ad playback
        seekBar.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
        muteToggleButton.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
        fullScreenToggleButton.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
    }
});
```

Set meta for *DFP* using an `AdData` object:

```java
List<String> adKeywords = Arrays.asList("testKeyword1", "testKeyword2");
Map<String, String> adExtras = new HashMap<>();
adExtras.put("adExtraKey1", "adExtraValue1");
adExtras.put("adExtraKey2", "adExtraValue2");
AdData adData = new AdData("TestTitle", adKeywords, adExtras);
mediaPlayerPlugin.setAdData(adData);
```

Everything else works just like it did before, no other code modification is required.

### Plugin limitations

- Ads Plugin does not support configuration changes, use `android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|keyboardHidden"` in your player activity.
This limitations is imposed by Google IMA SDK on which we depend to show ads.
- Ads Plugin uses it's own PlayerView: `tv.ustream.player.android.plugin.ads.AdsPlayerView`
- Seeking while an ad is playing will seek the original content, as ad seeking is not possible
