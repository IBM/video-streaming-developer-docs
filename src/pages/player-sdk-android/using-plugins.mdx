title: Using MediaPlayer Plugins
description: Using MediaPlayer Plugins
---

IBM Video Streaming Player SDK version 1.1.0 introduced a plugin system which enables you to extend the media player with additional features.
Plugins will be provided by IBM and must be provided during player initialization in `Player.initWithContent(ContentDescriptor, MediaPlayerModule)`.
These extensions may require different player views than `com.ibm.video.android.player.android.PlayerView`. PlayerView requirements for a plugin will always be stated
in this documentation but can also be queried from the MediaPlayerModule instance itself using `MediaPlayerModule.getSupportedPlayerViewType()`.
Make sure to always use the appropriate `PlayerView`.

Creation of the plugin is the user's responsibility, use the constructor of the desired plugin, provide appropriate parameters and set listeners.
When a plugin is passed to a Player instance it will be retained across configuration changes, however the listeners the user provided are not subject
to the usual `Player.attach()` / `Player.detach()` working. The user needs to manually set and remove those listeners.
The current `MediaPlayerModule` in use can be retrieved from the player instance using `Player.getMediaPlayerPlugin()` which returns
a `MediaPlayerModule` that will be cast to the appropriate class that was set during `initWithContent`. The user must know which MediaPlayerModule was
 set during init.

Please note that while a `MediaPlayerPlugin` provided through `Player.initWithContent` is retained across configuration changes,
the plugin itself might NOT support configuration changes at all due to plugin specific reasons. This will always be stated in the plugin's documentation
under the **Plugin limitations** section.
