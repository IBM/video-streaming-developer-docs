Please note that as of November 1st, 2022 IBM has discontinued support for the Watson Media Player SDK. It will not receive updates or technical support and may not fully function. For SDKs you have already downloaded, please do not use them to build applications and delete them from your archives. You may find information for alternative methods to create customized viewer experiences with our APIs on our [Developer Tools pages](https://developers.video.ibm.com/player-api-examples/custom-ui). Users may also continue to access Watson Media through the web, both at [video.ibm.com](https://video.ibm.com/) and through Embedded modules.

IBM Video Streaming Player SDK version 1.1.0 introduced a plugin system which enables you to extend the media player with additional features.
Plugins will be provided by IBM and must be provided during player initialization in `Player.initWithContent(ContentDescriptor, MediaPlayerModule)`.
These extensions may require different player views than `com.ibm.video.android.player.android.PlayerView`. PlayerView requirements for a plugin will always be stated
in this documentation but can also be queried from the MediaPlayerModule instance itself using `MediaPlayerModule.getSupportedPlayerViewType()`.
Make sure to always use the appropriate `PlayerView`.

Creation of the plugin is the user's responsibility, use the constructor of the desired plugin, provide appropriate parameters and set listeners.
When a plugin is passed to a Player instance it will be retained across configuration changes, however the listeners the user provided are not subject
to the usual `Player.attach()` / `Player.detach()` working. The user needs to manually set and remove those listeners.
The current `MediaPlayerModule` in use can be retrieved from the player instance using `Player.getMediaPlayerPlugin()` which returns
a `MediaPlayerModule` that will be cast to the appropriate class that was set during `initWithContent`. The user must know which MediaPlayerModule was
 set during init.

Please note that while a `MediaPlayerPlugin` provided through `Player.initWithContent` is retained across configuration changes,
the plugin itself might NOT support configuration changes at all due to plugin specific reasons. This will always be stated in the plugin's documentation
under the **Plugin limitations** section.
