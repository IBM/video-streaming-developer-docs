title: Pre-Buffering

UstreamPlayers initialized with `RECORDED` content can be buffered ahead of time.
This way an illusion of instantly starting videos can be achieved.
By the time a player is needed (`PlayerView` is set and `play()` is called) it is likely already in the `Paused` state, and playback can start immediately.
This feature's most obvious use-case is a newsfeed like playback experience, 
when video contents are scrolling into the view and need to be started as soon as possible.

## Usage

- Create a `ustreamPlayer` instance with an ID. (The ID can be the `contentDescriptors.toString()` value for simplicity, if duplicate contents are not required.)
- Initialize the created player with a **RECORDED** content.
- Call `pause()` on the player. The UstreamPlayer will buffer the content then it will wait.
At this stage it is not required to call `setPlayerListener()`, `setErrorListener()` and `attach()` if the callbacks are not relevant for you.
But you are free to do so if you are interested in the callbacks, but make sure you call `detach()` before changing listeners or playerView on the player,
and call `attach()` again so these changes can take effect.
- Later when the player is needed set your listeners and the `playerView`, call `attach()`
- Call `ustreamPlayer.play()` and if it is buffered the playback will start instantly.

**Example**:

```java
UstreamPlayerFactory ustreamPlayerFactory = new UstreamPlayerFactory(API_KEY, activity);
ContentDescriptor contentDescriptor = new ContentDescriptor(ContentType.RECORDED, 123456L);
UstreamPlayer player1 = ustreamPlayerFactory.createUstreamPlayer(contentDescriptor.toString());
player1.initWithContent(contentDescriptor);
player1.pause();

//... AT A LATER POINT, WHEN THE PLAYER IS NEEDED:

player1.setPlayerListener(playerListener);
player1.setErrorListener(errorListener);
player1.setPlayerView(playerView);
player1.attach();
player1.play();
```

**Note**:
- Only your device capabilities (mostly RAM) limit how many players you can pre-buffer. Keeping too many players can cause an OutOfMemoryError.
- When the players are no longer needed don't forget to `destroy()` them.
