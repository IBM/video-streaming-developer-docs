## Customizing the Player UI

The appearance of the Player is fully customizable. The provided sample application contains an example appearance with resources.

See `/src/main/res/layout/layout_video.xml` in the sample app.

## Localization

Localization is totally up to you, but there is an example in the `strings.xml` file of the sample application, 
containing the most likely needed strings.
